## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- SCSS custom properties (CS CODE EXTENSION)
- Flexbox, Inline-block
- Desktop-first workflow

### What I learned

I learned about flexbox, specifically on how to use the justify-content and align-items to position contents.

```scss
#main {
  box-shadow: 0px 22px 48px -34px $desaturated-blue;
}

$primary-size: 16px;
```

If you want more help with writing markdown, we'd recommend checking out [The Markdown Guide](https://www.markdownguide.org/) to learn more.
